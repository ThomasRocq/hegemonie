# Hegemonie

Hegemonie is an online management, strategy and diplomacy RPG. The current
repository is a reboot of what [Hegemonie](http://www.hegemonie.be) was
between 1999 and 2003. It is under heavily inactive construction.

The game engine is a [4X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4X) technical basis
for larger RPG games. The description of the game will sound familiar to RPG
players:
* Each **user** manages characters, each **character** manages cities
* Each **city** produces **resources**, grows a **knowledge** tree, evolves
  with **building** and trains **troops**.
* **Armies** can be setup to gather some troops and execute orders across
  the map.
