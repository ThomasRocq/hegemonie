        <h2>Hegemonie is back!</h2>
        <time datetime="2020-02-06">Published at February the 6th, 2020.</time>,
        <time datetime="2020-02-07">Edited at February the 7th, 2020.</time>
        <p>
            I am proud to announce that your favorite RPG between 1999 and 2003 will be back soon!
        </p>
        <p>
            The spirit of Hegemonie didn't vanish. As a new year's resolution I decided to reboot
            the game engine. I admit... it happened in a moment of nostalgia. While reconnecting
            with old players, I noticed that nobody forgot the experience. I was aware that a few
            of them continued the effort during one or two years after the official game ended.
            But I discovered that even 10 years after, some aficionados had rewritten an entire
            world. And you know what? They lack the skills to write a game engine.
        </p>

        <h3>What does make Hegemonie so special?</h3>
        <p>
            Hegemonie had <em>Game Masters</em>. Each GM was in charge of a game instance and
            its few non-player characters. He/She ensured a coarse narrative frame and stimulated
            a game instance.
        </p>
        <p>
            In its history, Hegemonie had 3 kinds of instances. The first was populated with
            players actually knowing each others in the real life. This was probably the most
            active but also the easiest to control. The second kind of population was 40%
            inactive, and the 60% remaining moving at a slow pace. The third instance was mostly
            active, 100% remote and prone to declare the war against the all local NPC.
        </p>
        <p>
            And the magic happened on all of those instances, because of the <em>Game Master</em>.
        </p>

        <h3>A new game engine</h3>
        <p>
            The current effort focuses the game engine. It of the world and its internal logic.
            It includes representing cities, learning science, raising troops, assaulting or defending,
            trading resources.
        </p>
        <p>
            The previous version of Hegemonie had major lacks that prohibited it to scale.
            The main lack was the absence of reporting on the activity on a game instance.
            It was not possible to spot inactive zones or fake accounts. Hegemonie provided
            no tool to the animators to trigger technical actions, spread rumors. The only
            lever was text-based Role-Play. It was just a nice game for communities of max
            40 players meeting in the real life. And worst of all, it was full-time job to
            animate such a community. This is a sign: it is not sustainable and it could not
            last long.
        </p>
        <p>
            The new game engine will address these limitations. I plan to provide the meaningful
            reporting to make unbalanced situations obvious. Representing the relationships
            between the characters is a must-have. The stimulation of the game requires to check
            the RP is respected. I must have only one goal in mind: make the animation becomes
            fun and hassle-free.
        </p>

        <h3>What's next?</h3>
        <p>
            What will happen after the development phase? Many things because there are many
            challenges. As an example there is a high risk that the system will adopt a new
            name because of trademark constraints. Only few items are on the roadmap. Only
            those who are certain yet.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 0: Content Creation</h4>
        <p>
            A game engine is cool but when it pushes a valuable content, it is much better!
            Then we will focus on creating a content like in the old days of Hegemonie.
            It won't be possible to recreate it as is because everything has been lost.
            Instead, we'll target the core configuration of the world and a scenario frame
            for a few empires that could be a sequel for Hegemonie VII.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 1: Friendly user test (Alpha Test)</h4>
        <p>
            The first step will start with players already aware of Hegemonie, i.e. the old
            players or their friends. Why? Because I am one of them, because I also do reboot
            the game for myself. All of us were college students with plenty of idle time.
            20 years later we turned into a workers and family guys & gals. So I have to check
            how the system must evolve to fit our current rhythm.
        </p>
        <p>
            Few assumptions need a validation. I have in mind the partition of the users
            into autonomous regions. I also think to the exchanges between compatible
            regions, etc. And the list is not exhaustive. This is the goal of this Alpha test:
            a technical validation of the design. The KPI is simple: do the players enjoy the
            experience?
        </p>
        <h4>Step 2: (Beta Test)</h4>
        <p>
            It is time to test the game on a pseudo-random population of players. They should
            be unaware of Hegemonie but simple RPG players and masters. My expectation is that
            the population will contain inactive citizens, fake accounts, remote players,
            etc etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            The benefit I expected from the Beta is a measurement of the time spent in game
            mastery. During the Beta we should be aware of lacks on the admin side. We should
            know more about the expected skill of the game masters. I expect a set of guidelines
            about how to populate game instances to ensure a constant activity. In term of number
            of players, of variety of characters.
        </p>

        <h3>Sustainability as a long term goal</h3>
        <p>
            All the burden described here-above has a cost. I am happy to pay it with my idle
            time for the initial development phase. But as soon as it is testable (a MVP),
            Hegemonie will require resources I do not have.
        </p>
        <p>
            Creative talent is my major lack. I cannot manage content creation. Here will
            I need the help of the community. Many ways are possible. It may take the form
            of crowd funding for well-bounded projects. It can also be a direct participation,
            artwork produced by the community itself.
        </p>
        <p>
            And there is moment when financial resources will also be required for the hosting
            itself. Here do I imagine two options. Either a yearly fundraiser or a minimal
            subscription. But ... honestly, I don't know. This is way too early.
